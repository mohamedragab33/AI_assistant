- 📊 Maintains historical price records
- 🔄 Continuous operation with error handling

---

### **2. 📈 Enhanced Trading Signal Generation**

#### **Before (No Persistence)**
```python
# Signals generated but lost after response
return {"signal": {...}}
```

#### **After (Full Database Integration)**
```python
# Signals saved to database with comprehensive tracking
trade_id = await save_trading_signal(signal_data)
await save_ai_training_data(indicators, action, signal_data)
```

**New Trading Signal Features:**
- 🔑 **Unique Trade IDs**: Each signal gets a unique identifier
- 💾 **Database Persistence**: All signals saved with complete metadata
- 📊 **Risk Management**: Stop loss, take profit, risk-reward ratios
- 🤖 **AI Training Data**: Automatic collection for model improvement

# Every signal generates training data for AI improvement
training_data = {
    "indicators": signal_indicators,
    "outcome": action,
    "market_conditions": current_market_state
}
await ai_training_repo.add_training_sample(training_data)
```

**AI Learning Benefits:**
- 📚 **Continuous Learning**: System learns from every signal
